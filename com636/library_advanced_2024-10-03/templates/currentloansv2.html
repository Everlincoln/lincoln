<h2>Loans (Version 2)</h2>
<p>A list of books on loan.</p>

<p>On this page, you can select a book from the dropdown and only that book will show.  See the function in app.py and the HTML page both called <b><em>currentloansv2</em></b>.</p>
<p>This page is an example of how the same template and function can be used with the SQL changing depending on the value selected.  
    This makes the function more complicated than two separate functions, but it means that only one function needs to be changed if you make any changes.
    Notice that the filter is removed if no book is selected.  (What in the function causes this to happen?)</p>
<p>Which way is better?  These are the types of decisions you need to discuss in your final web app report.</p>
<p>Notice the Jinja code that is used so that the book that was selected for filtering is displayed again in the dropdown box when the page loads (rather than &lt;Select a book&gt;), so the user can see more easily which book they selected.</p>
