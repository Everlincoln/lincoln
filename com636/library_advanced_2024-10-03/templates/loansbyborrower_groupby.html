<h2>Loans by Borrower</h2>
<p>An example of Jinja's <code>groupby</code> filter: A list of books on loan grouped by the borrower ID.</p>

<p>Use Jinja's <code>groupby</code> filter which groups <code>loan_list</code> by borrower_id.</p>
<p>This essentially creates a separate list of tuples for each <code>borrower_id</code>:</p>
    <p>All of the tuples in <code>loan_list</code> with the same <code>borrower_id</code> are grouped into a tuple
           which has the <code>borrower_id</code> and then a list of tuples for all of the query rows
           with that <code>borrower_id</code>.</p>
